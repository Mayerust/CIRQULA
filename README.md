## Features

- **AI-Driven Circular Economy Modeling**: Model complex material flows, identify bottlenecks, and design optimized resource loops using state-of-the-art algorithms.
- **Intelligent Waste Segregation Recommendations**: Leverage computer vision and data science to sort and track recyclables, organics, e-waste, and more.
- **Impact Dashboard & Analytics**: Visualize real-time key metrics such as carbon footprint, water usage, waste diverted, and circularity index.
- **Optimization Engine**: Solve multi-objective problems across cost, environmental impact, and resource cycles using mathematical programming and ML.
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time sensor data ingestion from smart bins, factories, or environmental monitors for actionable feedback loops.
- **Scenario Simulation**: Run ‘what-if’ analyses to understand the effect of material substitutions, process changes, and policy interventions.
- **Open API & Extensible Plugins**: Connect with other sustainability platforms, import/export data, and build custom add-ons.
- **Multi-user Collaboration**: Share models, results, and dashboards with teammates or stakeholders, fostering collective intelligence.
- **Beautiful, Science-driven UI**: Elegant data visualizations, interactive Sankey diagrams, animated flows, and modular widgets.
- **Secure & Scalable Architecture**: Modern backend for large datasets, role-based access, and encrypted communications.
